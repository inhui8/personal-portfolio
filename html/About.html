                <h3>About journey</h3>
                <p>I like to travel. In my memory, there are two trips with my friends that impressed me deeply.
                    One is went to Shanghai with my friends and the other one is went to Harbin before I came to 
                    America, both Shanghai and Harbin are beautiful cities, I really recommand you to travel if 
                    you have time, of course, plan to Harbin in winter!!!
